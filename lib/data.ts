Influenced by her mother\'s career of working with pastry chefs in local hotel settings and self-owned catering business, she began to bake on her own at the age of 11. Although baking was just for fun and for family gatherings, it soon grew to be a passion.',
            'She began honing her baking and decorating skills in college by becoming a bakery clerk at various bakeries in town. After returning home to Louisville, Kentucky, she decided to pursue her childhood dreams.  Coming from an African American and Hawaiian background, she set out  to create many deliciously unique pairings of flavors. At Black Palm Bakery, she is able to share her love of baking with her community.'
